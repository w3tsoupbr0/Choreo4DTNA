      <h2>Whitney High School teacher, Ms.Improta, choregraphed a special dance for her Dance I students to perform at the Barbie-Themed Pep-Ralley</h2>
      <h3>Our Reason for Choosing this Song and Choreography</h3>
        <p>Pior to the performance, Dance I students had been learning traditional jazz moves and implementing them into other styles genres of dance. "Dance the Night Away" is a perfect song to just get up and dance and Dance I students wanted to do exactly that.</p>
      <h3>Leading up to the Performance</h3>
        <a>I am very uncoordinated and struggle letting myself go. This dance was great for helping me loosen up. At first, I was anxious as i couldn't get the steps right but geradually i gained confidence and learned the dance. It was a terrific experience that I would like to revive again</a>
